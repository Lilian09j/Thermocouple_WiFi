# Thermocouple_WiFi
Development of a type K thermocouple with wireless data acquisition via WiFi from a Java App

Cold junction temperature measured by an LM335Z, MCP6002 AOPs in differential assembly, voltage sampling with an MCP3301 14bits ADC

The components used are thoses : ESP8266 (nodeMCU), MCP3301, MCP6002 and LM335Z
